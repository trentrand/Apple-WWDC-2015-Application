# Introduction
A UIScrollView that introduces the concept of 'pages', has built-in recycling and support for both vertical and horizontal orientations.

# VLBScrollView
VLBScrollView divides a scrollview in equally sized views, each given an index so that it can be backed by a datasource.

e.g a horizontal VLBScrollView of 3 with 196px for each view, yields the following:

<pre>
320px
 -    |---------------|          -
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |  196px   |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |---------------|          |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |          |
 480px|               |  196px   |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |         588px
 |    |               |          |
 |    |---------------|          |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |          |
 |    |               |          |
 -    |               |  196px   |
      |               |          |
  	  |               |          |
	    |---------------|          _
 

</pre>

The VLBScrollView is homogeneous, thus every view is of equal size and of the same type.

While scrolling, VLBScrollView will either use a recycled view or create an existing one if none available.
 
# What is included

* VLBScrollView
The 'VLBScrollView.xcodeproj' builds a static library 'libVLBScrollView.a'

# Cocoapods

Pending pull request.

# Versions
1.0 initial version. Support pages, horizontal/vertical orientation, tapable views, seeking.

# How to use

## Under Interface Builder
* Drag a UIView in the xib and change its type to VLBScrollView.
* Set its scrollViewdelegate property to a class that implements VLBScrollViewDelegate.
* Set its datasource property to a class that implements VLBScrollViewDatasource.
* Implement any @required methods to both protocols

## Under code

    VLBScrollView *verticalScrollView = [VLBScrollView newVerticalScrollView:self.view.frame config:^(VLBScrollView *scrollView, BOOL cancelsTouchesInView) {
        scrollView.datasource = self;
        scrollView.scrollViewDelegate = self;
    }];

		//scrollview will seek a 'page' so that it's always in full view
    scrollView.enableSeeking = YES;

		//every 'page' can be tapped to get a callback
    VLBScrollViewAllowSelection(scrollView, NO);


# Demo

See [VLBScrollViewApp][1].

# Future Work

Improve the API; when constructing a new VLBScrollView enforce the precondition to set a datasource/scrollViewDelegate.
Improve the API; make only the minimum implementation fall under the @required directive.
